## Mission

Our mission is to get environmental data used by many more people.

## Big Idea
We will achieve our mission by identifying and licensing satellite imagery that journalists will actually use in their reporting.

## Outcome

Hundreds of millions of people read stories supported by Earth imagery,  hundreds of outlets regularly rely on our content.

**Is this enough?**

> Economists that specifically study transactions with environmental externalities have proven, both in theory and in practice, the value of open information toward a more equitable and efficient allocation of natural resources.  People have won Nobel Prizes for this sort of thing.  The decision contexts are disparate, and the solutions therefore don’t easily scale.  However, open information is a common, necessary condition across all of the disparate contexts.  And it scales.  Open information is not sufficient for saving the world; but it’s a good, broad, and important start.

## Behavior and Interventions

|  **Behavior** | **Intervention**  |
|---|---|
| Journalists search for imagery. | Marketing through social media. A *lot* of imagery is produced and tagged.  |
| Journalists purchase imagery. |  License and payment systems that are already familiar to journalists. |
| Readers engage with the story. | Visually appealing, well-designed, and interactive.  Two-source authentication for trust. |
| **Outcome** | Normal people consume imagery.  |
